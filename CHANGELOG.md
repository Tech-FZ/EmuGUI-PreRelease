# EmuGUI v2.1.0.5704_dev "Fatima Nejla" (based on v2.1.0.5703_dev)

## WARNING

- This is a pre-release, so please don't use this for any productive purposes.
- You now need the latest version of your Linux distribution or at least Windows 10 to get official support for this release.

## Changes compared to v2.0.6.5617

- Thanks to Mizuki, we now have more flexible Windows-specific code.
- As per the depreciation policy, the old USB Tablet checkbox has been removed for good.
- The VM table on the database can now save information which you would set when starting the VM (excluding TPM information).
    - The bootfrom part has been added afterwards.
- The VM dialogs now show UI elements for those settings.
- The time settings can now be enabled and disabled in the VM dialogs using the RTC checkbox.
- The floppy seems to be able to get set on the dialogs.
- The newcomers can now be saved onto the database permanently.
- The CD Browse buttons work now.
- A class for storing VMs is on its way to replace the bad temporary file saving practice with good OOP practice.
- The edit VM dialog is being adapted to the new OOP-based approach.
- The Win2k checkbox is to be removed because of the OOP adaption.
    - The Edit VM dialog will now turn the Win2k optimisations off regardless of what you really want.
- The Edit VM dialog would now use the new OOP-based initialisation instead of the file-based one.
    - A log text had to be adjusted.
- A new Start VM dialog has already been implemented.
- The vmdata converter has been removed again.
- Editing the VM is now implemented.
- One-time edit is implemented.
- The HDA stuff had to be migrated.
- EmuGUI now utilises the Win32 API on Windows. This is to fix an issue where EmuGUI is not able to determine the Documents folder properly.
- The changes from 2.0.9 have been added to the changelog.
- The logs now tell you if your system is unsupported.
- In the "About" section, you will read a message about this thing (now also for RAM).
- You will find the updated requirements in the readme.
    - Formatting fixed
- The now required win32com has been added for Windows compiling procedures.

## Foreported 

### From v2.0.7.5618

- When creating new VMs, you can now choose custom BIOS files again.

### From v2.0.8.5619

- The keyboard layout is now set correctly.

### From v2.0.9.5620 (kinda)

- ARM machines are now defaulted to "virt" by EmuGUI. (or at least they should be)

## Changes compared to v2.1.0.5702_dev

- The new Fatima Nejla banner has been added.

### System requirement branch

- You are now notified via a dialog should your system become unsupported.
    - Formatting fixed.

## Known issues

- Unfortunately, you might have to run EmuGUI from the terminal on Linux.
- You will not be notified about any more updates for now as update.txt will not be updated.
- As for the TPM functionality, you must run `mkdir (insert-path-here)` and `swtpm socket --tpm2 --tpmstate dir=(insert-path-here) --ctrl type=unixio,path=(insert-path-here)/swtpm-sock --log level=20` in a terminal (You can leave the `--tpm2` argument away tho if you plan to use TPM 1.2 instead).
- The QCOW2 format is prone to not work for some Windows VMs.
- The new settings aren't applied yet. However, as the way to temporarily save VM settings is to be changed anyway, this won't be fixed until then.

## Changes compared to v2.0.0.5611

- In order for instances run by a desktop shortcut to run properly on Windows, a new variable will be used. The Ioana Rosa banner already is shown via that new variable.
    - The variable is used in the main window now.
        - The variable also applies on the icon.
    - The variable is also in an extra file.
        - The extra file has been updated to (hopefully) no longer conflict with folder names.
    - Some error codes related to the variable have been added.
    - The new pathfinder is used on the main window now, but doesn't work as expected (30th June, 2024 at 09:55 AM).
    - The pathfinder has been fixed (30th June, 2024 at 09:58 AM).
    - The pathfinder is now imported in all relevant files.
        - The execution directory has been assigned in those files.
        - Forgot the HardWare Plug-in Reader (HWPR) initially, so I had to add it there now.
    - So far, the pathfinder is in use in the following modules:
        - Main Window
        - Edit VM dialog
        - New VM dialog
        - Error dialog
        - Setting restart dialog
        - Start VM dialog
        - Translation script for "System default".
        - HWPR/Additional Hardware Selection Plug-In System (AHSPIS)
- The delcache scripts have been updated to remove the cache from the services folder as well.
- Unnecessary code has been removed from the following modules:
    - Edit VM dialog
    - Pathfinder
- I try to fix the Pathfinder on compiled binaries on Linux. (30th June, 2024 at 12:45 PM)
- The pathfinder needed some extra lines for Windows.
- The pathfinder should be fixed now, but the `--onefile` argument may no longer be used in PyInstaller.

- Unfortunately, you might have to run EmuGUI from the terminal on Linux.
- You will not be notified about any more updates for now as update.txt will not be updated.
- As for the TPM functionality, you must run `mkdir (insert-path-here)` and `swtpm socket --tpm2 --tpmstate dir=(insert-path-here) --ctrl type=unixio,path=(insert-path-here)/swtpm-sock --log level=20` in a terminal (You can leave the `--tpm2` argument away tho if you plan to use TPM 1.2 instead).
- The QCOW2 format is prone to not work for some Windows VMs.
- Due to the massive restructuring of the New and Edit VM dialogs, those will NOT be translated at this time, meaning they are English only. However, I'll be working on fixing that during development.

- An architecture list in the main window and its usage made the number of used initialisation code shrink. The old code has been commented out.
- The same optimisation efforts have been applied to the code which changes the settings and the code which starts VMs.
- The old feature list has been updated.
- Even though the Additional Hardware Selection Plug-In System (AHSPIS) still has to be made, I started working on JSON plug-ins for x86, PowerPC and ARM machines which are planned to be included with EmuGUI anyway.
- The copyright in the license file has been updated.
- The "Install on Linux" part of the readme has been corrected.
- I'm now working on what will become the MIPS and SPARC plug-ins.
- Some plug-ins have been separated.
- The generic plug-in is in the works.
- HAXM is now depreciated on EmuGUI.
- A copy of the New VM dialog has been edited.
- A copy of the Edit VM dialog has been edited.
- I'm doing my best to optimise EmuGUI by adapting the New VM dialog.
- For that, the plug-in reader has been prepared.
- The delcache scripts have been updated.
- However, due to translation issues, the New VM dialog is exclusively in English at this time.
- The Edit VM dialog is also to be shrunk in size.
- The New and Edit VM dialogs are being optimised further.
- An issue in the New VM dialog which caused the VM creation to be incomplete has been fixed.
- The Start VM dialog has been adjusted.
- The SPARC64 plug-in has been corrected.
- An Alpha plug-in is in the making.
- The Alpha support is mostly there. However, VMs don't seem to run.
- As suggested by [levelad](https://github.com/levelad), an experimental option to run WHPX with `kernel-irqchip=off` has been added.
- The translation of the main window was updated.
- I'm working on bringing back translations for the New VM dialog. However, it will take a while until I can actually re-activate them.
- Some things on the New VM dialog had to be corrected.
- The readme had to be corrected again.
- Work on the RISC-V 32/64 plug-in has begun.
- The translation files had to be corrected.
- The New VM dialog is now ready to be translated again.
- RISC-V 32-bit support has been added. Sorry, but I have to make a second QEMU page starting with RISC-V 64-bit.
- RISC-V 64-bit support has been added. From now on, there are two QEMU tabs.
- The translations for RISC-V have been added.
- I'm working on bringing back the translation functionality on the Edit VM dialog.
- April Fools! (from 2.0.0.5606_b2)
- Networking should now work on RISC-V and Alpha.
- Word wrapping is activated in the BIOS thing on the New VM dialog now.
- Thanks to imwez (Discord username), the Portuguese translation is now more complete.
- There are efforts in fixing the readme.
- The main UI file has been recreated.
- User0 is now responsible for the Debian packages. They will come out later than the portable binaries tho.
- Speaking about portable binaries, Windows executables will be built with Python 3.12 from now on.

## Foreported from v1.2.3.5513

- SPARC64 VMs didn't have network capabilities under any circumstances. This is now fixed.

## Changes compared to v2.0.0.5607_rc1

- The additional argument for KVM is no longer mentioned in the readme because it is no longer necessary.
- The tab order in the first QEMU tab has been adjusted.
- Welcome to the team, PrelevatedInsider18204.
- The main window has been translated as far as possible.
- EmuGUI now has a Guilded server.

## Known issues

- Unfortunately, you might have to run EmuGUI from the terminal on Linux.
- You will not be notified about any more updates for now as update.txt will not be updated.
- As for the TPM functionality, you must run `mkdir (insert-path-here)` and `swtpm socket --tpm2 --tpmstate dir=(insert-path-here) --ctrl type=unixio,path=(insert-path-here)/swtpm-sock --log level=20` in a terminal (You can leave the `--tpm2` argument away tho if you plan to use TPM 1.2 instead).
- The QCOW2 format is prone to not work for some Windows VMs.
- Due to the massive restructuring of the New and Edit VM dialogs, those will NOT be translated at this time, meaning they are English only. However, I'll be working on fixing that during development.

# EmuGUI v2.0.0.5607_rc1 "Ioana Rosa" (based on v2.0.0.5606_b2)

- The delcache scripts have been updated.
- However, due to translation issues, the New VM dialog is exclusively in English at this time.
- The Edit VM dialog is also to be shrunk in size.

## Known issues

- Unfortunately, you might have to run EmuGUI from the terminal on Linux.
- You will not be notified about any more updates for now as update.txt will not be updated.
- As for the TPM functionality, you must run `mkdir (insert-path-here)` and `swtpm socket --tpm2 --tpmstate dir=(insert-path-here) --ctrl type=unixio,path=(insert-path-here)/swtpm-sock --log level=20` in a terminal (You can leave the `--tpm2` argument away tho if you plan to use TPM 1.2 instead).
- The QCOW2 format is prone to not work for some Windows VMs.

# EmuGUI v2.0.0.5601_dev "Ioana Rosa" (based on v2.0.0.5600_dev)

## WARNING

You now need the latest version of your Linux distribution or at least Windows 10 to get official support for this pre-release.

## Changes compared to v1.2.2.5512

- As always, EmuGUI 2.0 receives another codename, in this case "Ioana Rosa".
- An architecture list in the main window and its usage made the number of used initialisation code shrink. The old code has been commented out.
- The same optimisation efforts have been applied to the code which changes the settings and the code which starts VMs.
- The old feature list has been updated.
- Even though the Additional Hardware Selection Plug-In System (AHSPIS) still has to be made, I started working on JSON plug-ins for x86, PowerPC and ARM machines which are planned to be included with EmuGUI anyway.
- The copyright in the license file has been updated.

## Foreported from v1.2.3.5513

- SPARC64 VMs didn't have network capabilities under any circumstances. This is now fixed.

## Changes compared to v1.2.3.5513 and v2.0.0.5600_dev

- The "Install on Linux" part of the readme has been corrected.
- I'm now working on what will become the MIPS and SPARC plug-ins.
- Some plug-ins have been separated.
- The generic plug-in is in the works.
- HAXM is now depreciated on EmuGUI.
- A copy of the New VM dialog has been edited.
- A copy of the Edit VM dialog has been edited.

# EmuGUI v1.1.0.5406_b1 "Sara Angeline" (based on v1.1.0.5405_dev)

## WARNING

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and derivates will be no longer supported as EmuGUI hosts from 8th July, 2023. You would then need at least Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or one of its derivates.

## Changes compared to v1.0.2.5312

- New feature level, new codename. I decided to call it "Sara Angeline" based on what I want to add so far.
- Language files for French, Spanish, Czech, Russian, Belarusian and Romanian have been prepared.
- Thanks for translating EmuGUI into Russian and Belarusian, Danik2343.
- The old feature list has been updated again.
- The requests list has been commented out.
- Happy Easter! A banner just for easter has been added.
- As I noticed the code would go confusing, I decided to use text files containing the strings for affected combo boxes instead. The code which was used before this update has been commented out for now so we can roll back if something is wrong.
- The edit VM dialogue for choosing a VHD has been stripped down to save some time for now.
- The program has been translated into Spanish. (Thanks, SuperVitu64)
- In the contributors file, you'll now be credited with what you did, not only that you did something.
- Portuguese support has been added (Thanks, PurpleVibe32 and Rafael Magalhães).
- The New and Start VM UIs have been polished.
- TPM functionality for emulated TPM devices is implemented (but you will need a terminal and the feature is for Linux only).
- Hardware acceleration is now easier to set up. You can choose between no acceleration, TCG, HAXM (unsupported, can't help you), WHPX (can't help you) and KVM.

- The Icelake-Client x86/x64 CPU, which has been removed from QEMU 7.1, is depreciated on EmuGUI now. Please change the CPU on affected VMs as soon as possible. This measure is already present in 0.7.6.5112, but it had to be written into this version as well.
- The old editing VM dialog might have crashed if your installation didn't contain the EmuGUI.png icon. That is now fixed in both 0.7 and 0.8.
